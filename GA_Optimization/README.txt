 Instructions for running Genetic Algorithm using decimal representation of coordinates:

 Implementation of genetic algorithm using decimal representation of coordinates is done using GA.py. For setting values of parameters, edit GA.conf, which enumerates the list of parameters with
 description. Then execute using ./run_GA.sh

 Instructions for running Genetic Algorithm using binary representation of coordinates:

 Each coordinate is represented as a bit string of 7 bits. Thus the three dimensions of the room are divided into 128 parts. Implementation of Genetic Algorithm with binary representation of coordinates
 is  done using GA_bin.py. To execute, first set values of parameters in GA_bin.conf. Next, execute using ./run_GA_bin.sh

 Instructions for running test cases:
 For each binary representation as well as decimal representation of coordinates, go to the directory of test case and execute the run file.
   An example run for the binary case is as follows:
   Go to the directory Testcases/Binary/TestCase1 and execute ./run_Testcase1.sh

   Similarly, an example run for the decimal case is as follows:
   Go to the directory Testcases/Decimal/TestCase1 and execute ./run_Testcase1.sh
